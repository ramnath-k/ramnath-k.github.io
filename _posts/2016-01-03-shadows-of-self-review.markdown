[Shadows of Self][shadows-of-self] is a great sequel to [The Alloy of Law][alloy-of-law]. While Alloy of Law was wholly concerned with mortals, Shadows of Self brings Wax into the domain of Gods. The book also expands Kandra lore to a large extent and takes us into their world. It raises an interesting question, 'Who can block a God's power?' which I think sets the stage for the next book in the trilogy. It allows us to glimpse the limits of God's powers to some extent which makes for a good discussion over coffee with friends.

It is surprising how much of the novel takes place in one night. It is more like an action film with chase after chase where Wax and co. try to stop a very very crafty villain. But there is one thing the villain does again and again - not killing any of Wax and co. inspite of getting many chances. The why of this is explained in the end which also has a great twist about Wax's personal life. You will feel very sorry for Wax at the end. The villain's character is that of madness which fuels a single minded purpose to bring down civilization itself. What drove the villain mad is explained to an extent in the novel which is nice. 

Wayne hogs the limelight in many sections with his wit and very unique world view. Marasi brings statistical analysis and knowledge of crowd behaviour to help avert a great crisis. Steris shows the good side of her meticulous planning self. Ranette makes a cameo appearance. 

In summary, a must read for Sanderson fans and a good read for all others.
